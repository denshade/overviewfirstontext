        </p>
        <h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>
        <p>Heat stroke generally presents with a hyperthermia of greater than 40.6&nbsp;°C (105.1&nbsp;°F) in combination with disorientation and a lack of <a href="/wiki/Sweating" class="mw-redirect" title="Sweating">sweating</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Before a heat stroke occurs, people show signs of <a href="/wiki/Heat_exhaustion" title="Heat exhaustion">heat exhaustion</a> such as dizziness, mental confusion, headaches, and weakness; if a heat stroke occurs when the person is asleep, symptoms may be harder to notice. However, in exertional heat stroke, the affected person may sweat excessively.<sup id="cite_ref-OSH_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OSH-7">[7]</a></sup> Young children, in particular, may have <a href="/wiki/Seizures" class="mw-redirect" title="Seizures">seizures</a>. Eventually, <a href="/wiki/Unconsciousness" title="Unconsciousness">unconsciousness</a>, <a href="/wiki/Organ_failure" class="mw-redirect" title="Organ failure">organ failure</a>, and death will result.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrisons_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrisons-8">[8]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <h3>Biological</h3>
        <p>Heat stroke occurs when thermoregulation is overwhelmed by a combination of excessive metabolic production of heat (exertion), excessive environmental heat, and insufficient or impaired heat loss, resulting in an abnormally high body temperature. Substances that inhibit cooling and cause dehydration such as <a href="/wiki/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Stimulants" class="mw-redirect" title="Stimulants">stimulants</a>, <a href="/wiki/Medications" class="mw-redirect" title="Medications">medications</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ageing#Effects_of_ageing" title="Ageing">age-related</a> physiological changes predispose to so-called "classic" or non-exertional heat stroke (NEHS), most often in elderly and infirm individuals in summer situations with insufficient ventilation. Exertional heat stroke (EHS) can happen in young people without health problems or medications&nbsp;–  most often in <a href="/wiki/Athlete" title="Athlete">athletes</a>, outdoor <a href="/wiki/Laborer" title="Laborer">laborers</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Military_personnel" title="Military personnel">military personnel</a> engaged in <a href="/wiki/Exercise_intensity" title="Exercise intensity">strenuous hot-weather activity</a> or in <a href="/wiki/Certified_first_responder" title="Certified first responder">certified first responders</a> wearing heavy <a href="/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment" title="Personal protective equipment">personal protective equipment</a>. In environments that are not only hot but also humid, it is important to recognize that <a href="/wiki/Humidity#Human_comfort" title="Humidity">humidity</a> reduces the degree to which the body can cool itself by perspiration and evaporation. For humans and other <a href="/wiki/Warm-blooded" title="Warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a> animals, excessive body temperature can disrupt enzymes regulating biochemical reactions that are essential for cellular respiration and the functioning of major organs.<sup id="cite_ref-Harrisons_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Harrisons-8">[8]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <h3>Cars</h3>
        <p>When the outside temperature is 21&nbsp;°C (70&nbsp;°F), the temperature inside a car parked in direct sunlight can quickly exceed 49&nbsp;°C (120&nbsp;°F). Young children, elderly adults, or disabled individuals left alone in a vehicle are at particular risk of succumbing to heat stroke. "Heat stroke in children and in the elderly can occur within minutes, even if a car window is opened slightly."<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> As these groups of individuals may not be able to open car doors or to express discomfort verbally (or audibly, inside a closed car), their plight may not be immediately noticed by others in the vicinity.
        </p>
        <p><a href="/wiki/Pet" title="Pet">Pets</a> are even more susceptible than humans to heat stroke in cars, as dogs (the animals usually involved), cats, and many other animals cannot produce whole-body sweat to cool themselves. Leaving the pet at home with plenty of water on hot days is recommended instead, or, if a dog must be brought along, it can be <a href="/wiki/Leash" title="Leash">tied up</a> outside the destination and provided with a full water bowl.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
    </p>
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>The risk of heat stroke can be reduced by observing precautions to avoid overheating and dehydration. Light, loose-fitting clothes will allow perspiration to evaporate and cool the body. Wide-brimmed hats in light colors help prevent the sun from warming the head and neck. Vents on a hat will help cool the head, as will sweatbands wetted with cool water. Strenuous exercise should be avoided during daylight hours in hot weather, as should remaining in confined spaces (such as automobiles) without <a href="/wiki/Air-conditioning" class="mw-redirect" title="Air-conditioning">air-conditioning</a> or adequate <a href="/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)" title="Ventilation (architecture)">ventilation</a>.
        </p><p>In hot weather, people need to drink plenty of cool liquids to replace fluids lost from <a href="/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">sweating</a>. <a href="/wiki/Thirst" title="Thirst">Thirst</a> is not a reliable sign that a person needs fluids. A better indicator is the color of <a href="/wiki/Urine" title="Urine">urine</a>. A dark yellow color may indicate dehydration.<sup id="cite_ref-OSH_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OSH-7">[7]</a></sup>
    </p>
        <p>The <a href="/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration" title="Occupational Safety and Health Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> in the United States publishes a QuickCard with a checklist designed to help protect from heat stress:<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>
        </p><ul><li>Know signs/symptoms of heat-related illnesses.</li>
        <li>Block out direct sun and other heat sources.</li>
        <li>Drink fluids often, and <i>before</i> you are thirsty.</li>
        <li>Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothes.</li>
        <li>Avoid beverages containing alcohol or caffeine.</li></ul>
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment of heat stroke involves rapid mechanical cooling along with standard resuscitation measures.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>The body temperature must be lowered quickly. The person should be moved to a cool area (indoors, or at least in the shade) and clothing removed to promote heat loss (passive cooling). Active cooling methods should also be used, if possible: The person is bathed in cold water, or a hyperthermia vest can be applied. (However, wrapping the person in wet towels or clothes can actually act as insulation and increase the body temperature.) Cold compresses to the <a href="/wiki/Torso" title="Torso">torso</a>, head, neck, and <a href="/wiki/Groin" title="Groin">groin</a> will help cool the victim. A fan or dehumidifying air-conditioning unit may be used to aid in evaporation of the water (evaporative method).
        </p>
        <p>Immersing a person into a tub of cold water (immersion method) is a widely recognized method of cooling. This method may require the effort of several people and the person should be monitored carefully during the treatment process. Immersion should be avoided for an unconscious person, but if there is no alternative, the person's head must be held above water.
        </p>
        <p>Immersion in very cold water was once thought to be counterproductive by reducing blood flow to the skin and thereby preventing heat from escaping the body core. However, this hypothesis has been challenged in experimental studies,<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> as well as by systematic reviews of the clinical data,<sup id="cite_ref-J-Athl_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-J-Athl-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> indicating that cutaneous <a href="/wiki/Vasoconstriction" title="Vasoconstriction">vasoconstriction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shivering" title="Shivering">shivering thermogenesis</a> do not play a dominant role in the decrease in core body temperature brought on by cold water immersion. This can be seen in the effect of submersion <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a>, where the body temperature decrease is directly related to environmental temperature, and though <a href="/wiki/Cold_shock_response" title="Cold shock response">bodily defenses</a> slow the decrease in temperature for a time, they ultimately fail to maintain endothermic homeostasis. <a href="/wiki/Dantrolene" title="Dantrolene">Dantrolene</a>, a direct-acting paralytic which abolishes shuddering and is effective in many other forms of hyperthermia, including <a href="/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome" title="Serotonin syndrome">centrally-</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malignant_hyperthermia" title="Malignant hyperthermia">peripherally-</a> and <a href="/wiki/2,4-dinitrophenol" class="mw-redirect" title="2,4-dinitrophenol">cellularly-mediated</a> thermogenesis, has no individual or additive effects to cooling in the context of heat stroke,<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> showing a lack of endogenous thermogenic response to cold water immersion. Thus, aggressive ice-water immersion remains the <a href="/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)" title="Gold standard (test)">gold standard</a> for life-threatening heat stroke.<sup id="cite_ref-J-Athl_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-J-Athl-16">[16]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>Hydration is important in cooling the person. In mild cases of concomitant dehydration, this can be achieved by drinking water, or commercial isotonic <a href="/wiki/Sports_drink" title="Sports drink">sports drinks</a> may be used as a substitute. In exercise- or heat-induced dehydration, <a href="/wiki/Electrolyte_imbalance" title="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</a> can result, and can be worsened by <a href="/wiki/Water_intoxication" title="Water intoxication">excess consumption of water</a>. <a href="/wiki/Hyponatremia" title="Hyponatremia">Hyponatremia</a> can be corrected by intake of <a href="/wiki/Hypertonic" class="mw-redirect" title="Hypertonic">hypertonic</a> fluids. Absorption is rapid and complete in most people but if the person is confused, unconscious, or unable to tolerate oral fluid, then an <a href="/wiki/Intravenous_drip" class="mw-redirect" title="Intravenous drip">intravenous drip</a> may be necessary for rehydration and electrolyte replacement.
        </p><p>The person's condition should be reassessed and stabilized by <a href="/wiki/Medic" title="Medic">trained medical personnel</a>. The person's heart rate and breathing should be monitored, and <a href="/wiki/CPR" class="mw-redirect" title="CPR">CPR</a> may be necessary if the person goes into <a href="/wiki/Cardiac_arrest" title="Cardiac arrest">cardiac arrest</a>.
    </p>
        <h2>Prognosis</h2>
        <p>It was long believed that heat strokes lead only rarely to permanent deficits and that <a href="/wiki/Convalescence" title="Convalescence">convalescence</a> is almost complete. However, following the <a href="/wiki/1995_Chicago_heat_wave" title="1995 Chicago heat wave">1995 Chicago heat wave</a>, researchers from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Medical_Center" title="University of Chicago Medical Center">University of Chicago Medical Center</a> studied all 58 patients with heat stroke severe enough to require intensive care at 12 area hospitals between July 12 and 20, 1995, ranging in age from 25 to 95 years. Nearly half of these patients died within a year&nbsp;–  21 percent before and 28 percent after release from the hospital. Many of the survivors had permanent loss of independent function; one-third had severe functional impairment at discharge, and none of them had improved after one year. The study also recognized that because of overcrowded conditions in all the participating hospitals during the crisis, the immediate care&nbsp;–  which is critical&nbsp;–  was not as comprehensive as it should have been.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
        <p>In <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, hundreds die every year from summer heat waves,<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> including <a href="/wiki/2015_Indian_heat_wave" title="2015 Indian heat wave">more than 2,500 in the year 2015</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Later that same summer, the <a href="/wiki/2015_Pakistani_heat_wave" class="mw-redirect" title="2015 Pakistani heat wave">2015 Pakistani heat wave</a> caused about 2,000 deaths.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Other animals</h2>
        <p>Heatstroke can affect livestock, especially in hot, humid weather; or if the horse, cow, sheep or other is unfit, overweight, has a dense coat, is overworked, or is left in a horsebox in full sun. Symptoms include drooling, panting, high temperature, sweating, and rapid pulse.
        </p>
        <p>The animal should be moved to shade, drenched in cold water and offered water or electrolyte to drink.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>
